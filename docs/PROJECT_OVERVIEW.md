# Meeshy Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Meeshy** is a high-performance real-time multilingual messaging platform designed to break language barriers in global communication. Our vision is to create a world where people can communicate naturally in their preferred language while everyone receives messages in their own language instantly.

## 🌟 Mission Statement

> *"Meet without shyness! Connect the world, one translation at a time."*

We believe that language should never be a barrier to meaningful communication. Meeshy empowers global teams, communities, and friends to chat naturally while providing instant, high-quality translations to bridge linguistic gaps.

## 👨‍💻 Development Reality

**Meeshy** is currently developed by a single developer (J. Charles N. M.) with rapid iteration and continuous improvement. The project started in December 2023 and has evolved through multiple alpha versions with a focus on:

- **Performance optimization** and Docker containerization
- **ML translation integration** with advanced models
- **Real-time messaging** with WebSocket technology
- **Unified deployment** options for easy setup
- **Comprehensive testing** and automation

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Microservices Architecture

Meeshy follows a modern microservices architecture designed for high performance, scalability, and maintainability:

```

│   Frontend      │◄───────────────────►│    Gateway       │
│   (Next.js 15)  │   Socket.IO + JWT   │   (Fastify 5.1)  │
│   React 19      │   Authentication    │   WebSocket      │
└─────────────────┘                     └──────────────────┘

                                         gRPC + ZeroMQ + Protobuf
                                                  ▼

### Translation Flow
```
1. User A sends "Hello" (English) → Gateway (WebSocket)
2. Gateway determines required languages for participants
3. Gateway → Translator (gRPC + ZeroMQ): Request translation to all languages
4. Translator processes with worker pool:
   • Checks cache (Redis + MessageTranslation)
   • Translates missing languages with quantized ML models
   • Stores translations with optimized cache keys
   • Processes 50+ concurrent translations
5. Translator → Gateway: All translations via gRPC
6. Gateway broadcasts via WebSocket based on preferences:
   • User B (systemLanguage: "fr") → receives "Bonjour"
   • User C (regionalLanguage: "es") → receives "Hola"
   • User D (systemLanguage: "en") → receives "Hello"
```
