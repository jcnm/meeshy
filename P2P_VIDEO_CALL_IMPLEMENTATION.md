- Reusable hooks for business logic
- Presentational components for UI

### Web Audio API Pipeline
```
Input MediaStream → AudioContext → Effect Processors → Output MediaStream
                                        ↓
                                  Dynamic Chaining

### WebRTC Stats Monitoring
```
RTCPeerConnection.getStats() → Parse Stats → Calculate Quality Level
                                    ↓
                            Update UI in Real-time
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Audio Effects Implementation

**Simplified Pitch Shifting:**
The current implementation uses gain-based pitch shifting as a proof-of-concept. For production, consider using:
- **Tone.js** - Full-featured Web Audio framework
- **PitchShift.js** - Dedicated pitch shifting library
- FFT-based pitch detection and manipulation

**Effect Chaining:**
Effects are chained dynamically based on enabled state:
```
Source → Effect 1 → Effect 2 → ... → Destination
```

### Quality Monitoring Algorithm

```typescript
// Quality Level Calculation
if (packetLoss < 1 && rtt < 100) return 'excellent';
if (packetLoss < 3 && rtt < 200) return 'good';
if (packetLoss < 5 && rtt < 300) return 'fair';
return 'poor';
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Audio Processing**: Minimal CPU overhead with Web Audio API
2. **Stats Polling**: Updates every 2 seconds (configurable)
3. **Effect Switching**: No audio glitches on enable/disable
4. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup on unmount

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Audio Effects
1. Pitch shifting is simplified - production should use Tone.js
2. Formant shifting is approximated with filters
3. Background sounds need actual audio files (not included)
4. No real-time waveform visualization

### Connection Quality
1. WebRTC stats API varies between browsers
2. Some stats may not be available on all platforms
3. Quality thresholds are fixed (not adaptive)

### Phase 1 - Audio Effects
- [ ] Integrate Tone.js for professional pitch shifting

## 🎓 Code Examples

### Using Audio Effects Hook
```typescript
const { effectsState, toggleEffect, updateEffectParams } = useAudioEffects({
  inputStream: localStream,
});

// Toggle effect
toggleEffect('voice-coder');

// Update parameters
updateEffectParams('voice-coder', { pitch: 5, strength: 80 });
```

### Using Call Quality Hook
```typescript
const { qualityStats } = useCallQuality({
  peerConnection: activePeerConnection,
  updateInterval: 2000,
});

// qualityStats contains:
// - level: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor'
// - packetLoss, rtt, bitrate, jitter
```

## 📝 Notes for Developers

1. **Audio Context Lifecycle**: AudioContext is created once and reused
2. **Effect Processors**: Disposed properly on unmount
3. **State Management**: Uses Zustand for call state, local state for UI
4. **Error Handling**: All audio operations wrapped in try-catch
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Audio Processing**: All processing done client-side
2. **No Audio Upload**: Effects applied in real-time
3. **WebRTC Stats**: Read-only access to connection stats
4. **Background Sounds**: Loaded from trusted sources only
