## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control** (USER, ADMIN, MODO, AUDIT, ANALYST, BIGBOSS)
- **Secure token storage** and transmission
- **Automatic session cleanup** on logout

### Data Protection

- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive communications
- **Database encryption** at rest
- **Redis encryption** for cached data
- **Secure environment variable** management

### Network Security

- **HTTPS/WSS** for all communications
- **CORS configuration** to prevent unauthorized access

- **Secure model storage** and distribution
- **Input sanitization** for translation requests
- **Output validation** to prevent injection attacks

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep your JWT tokens secure** and don't share them
2. **Use strong passwords** for authentication
3. **Enable 2FA** when available
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately
5. **Keep your client updated** to the latest version

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** before processing
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
5. **Follow secure coding practices** and guidelines

### For Deployments

1. **Use HTTPS** in production
2. **Configure proper CORS** settings
3. **Set up monitoring** and alerting
4. **Regular security updates** for dependencies
5. **Backup and disaster recovery** procedures
