# Project Structure Guidelines

## Directory Organization
- Project Type: microservices
- Source Directory: src/
- Component Organization: feature-based

## File Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase
- Files: kebab-case
- Import Style: absolute

## Structure Requirements

- Service-oriented architecture
- Clear API boundaries between services
- Independent scaling and deployment


## Best Practices
- Keep related files together
- Use consistent naming across the project
- Maintain clear import/export patterns
- Document architectural decisions

## Code Examples:

```
src/

├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── services/
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── hooks/
│       └── services/
